# so_open-source_survey_analysis

## Installation
The code was written in Python 3 and requires the following packages: Pandas, Numpy, Collections, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, re and missingno.

## Project Motivation
The motivation behind this analysis is to explore how stackoverflow community looks like and how opensource contribution is at a heart of it. It further looks at how contributing to opensource help you earn more. There are 3 questions I explore.

* Question 1. Who are the users of Stackoverflow in 2019 ?
* Question 2. How soon one can start contributing to opensource ?
* Question 3. If one contributes to opensource will one earn more ?

## File Descriptions
All analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook Stackoverflow_annual_developer_survey_analysis.ipynb.

To run this code, it is first necessary to download the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset from https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey. Make sure you run the notebook on collaboratory as some graphs may not be plotted due to plotly's backend incompatibility with few backends

## Results
The main findings of this analysis are summarised in a blog post available [here](https://medium.com/convergeml/stack-overflow-and-open-source-5ddcd38213f).
